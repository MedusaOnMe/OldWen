# WenDex Security Recommendations

## Current Security Issues

1. **Weak Encryption**: Development fallback key is insecure
2. **Centralized Storage**: All private keys in Firestore
3. **Manual Payments**: Requires exposing private keys for DexScreener

## Recommended Security Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Encryption
```bash
# Generate strong encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32 > wallet_encryption.key

# Use in environment
WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(cat wallet_encryption.key)
```

### 2. Key Derivation Function
```typescript
// Use PBKDF2 or scrypt for key derivation
const encryptionKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
  process.env.MASTER_KEY, 
  'wendex-salt', 
  100000, 
  32, 
  'sha256'
);
```

### 3. Environment Security
- Store encryption key in secure secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Never commit encryption keys to version control
- Use different keys for different environments

### 4. Multi-Signature Wallets (Recommended)
```typescript
// Create 2-of-3 multisig for each campaign
const multisigWallet = {
  threshold: 2,
  signers: [
    platformWallet,  // Automated for refunds
    adminWallet,     // Manual verification
    auditWallet      // Optional oversight
  ]
};
```

### 5. Hardware Security Module (Production)
- Use AWS CloudHSM or similar for key storage
- Private keys never leave secure hardware
- API calls for signing operations

### 6. Audit Trail
```typescript
interface KeyUsageLog {
  walletId: string;
  operation: 'sign' | 'decrypt' | 'access';
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  purpose: string;
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix encryption key (use proper random key)
2. **Short-term**: Implement multisig wallets
3. **Medium-term**: Add HSM integration
4. **Long-term**: Full audit system

## Manual DexScreener Payment Process

### Secure Workflow:
1. Campaign reaches funding goal
2. System generates payment request
3. Admin manually verifies campaign legitimacy
4. Admin uses secure workstation to:
   - Decrypt private key
   - Sign DexScreener payment transaction
   - Immediately re-encrypt and rotate key
5. Log all operations for audit

### Security Measures:
- Air-gapped signing workstation
- Time-limited key access
- Multi-person verification for large amounts
- Automated alerts for unusual activity

## Code is Law Principle

To align with "code is law":
- All security policies encoded in smart contracts
- Transparent refund mechanisms
- Public audit trails (without exposing keys)
- Immutable escrow conditions
- Time-locked releases
